An introduction into some of the basic features of the MEGA65 Full Color Text Mode, the one used in Mandelbrot Explorer 65.

Mandelbrot Explorer 65 is both a mandelbrot set generator for the MEGA65 as well as the project where I learn and test new features of the MEGA65. My goal is to make a video about each new trick or feature, so you can learn from it too.
